# Basic Selfbot for bumping a server that uses Disboard's Bot.
### Bot will bump every 120 min's and edit "!d bump" message to a random message after completion in attempt to hide its actions from your server mates.

### Start session with "--bump", that session will be assigned a key, with which you can stop the session.

### Bug: When user starts a session then proceeds to stop correctly, the aknowledgemnt message won't send until the bump timer is up, will fix soon.

### Setup: If you can't setup a simple Python bot then you should'nt be self-botting... 

### Enjoy!
